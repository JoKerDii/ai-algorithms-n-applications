RLHF is an integral part of the modern LLM training pipeline due to its ability to incorporate human preferences into the optimization landscape, which can improve the model's helpfulness and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, I will break down RLHF in a step-by-step manner to provide a reference for understanding its central idea and importance. Following up on the previous Ahead of AI article that featured Llama 2, this article will also include a comparison between ChatGPT's and Llama 2's way of doing RLHF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, for those wondering about the relevance or necessity of RLHF, I also added a section highlighting the most recent alternatives — I intend to update this section regularly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Modern transformer-based LLMs, such as ChatGPT or Llama 2, undergo a 3-step training procedure:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Pretraining\n",
      "2. Supervised finetuning\n",
      "3. Alignment\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially, in the pretraining phase, the models absorb knowledge from enormous unlabeled text datasets. The subsequent supervised finetuning refines these models to better adhere to specific instructions. Lastly, the alignment stage hones the LLMs to respond more helpfully and safely to user prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that this training pipeline is based on [OpenAI's InstructGPT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155), which details the process for GPT-3. This process is widely considered to be the approach behind ChatGPT. Later, we will also compare this method with [Meta AI's latest Llama 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288) model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's begin with the initial step, *pretraining*, as depicted below.\n",
      "\n",
      "![img](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52beec42-4ba4-4477-80d3-4dbb8f3162d3_1600x950.png)\n",

      "\n",
      "Illustration of the LLM pretraining step\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretraining typically occurs on a vast text corpus comprising billions to trillions of tokens. In this context, we employ a straightforward next-word prediction task in which the model predicts the subsequent word (or token) from a provided text.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're unfamiliar with this next-word prediction task, you might like my earlier article *Understanding Encoder And Decoder LLMs*:\n",
      "\n",
      "One point worth emphasizing is that this type of pretraining allows us to leverage large, unlabeled datasets. As long as we can use the data without infringing on copyrights or disregarding creator preferences, we can access large datasets without the need for manual labeling. In fact, in this pretraining step, the \"label\" is the subsequent word in the text, which is already part of the dataset itself (hence, this pretraining approach is often called self-supervised learning).\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is s*upervised finetuning*, which is summarized in the figure below.\n",
      "\n",
      "![img](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97601e27-cee1-443d-b9ac-a5ea6f802fc9_2156x1164.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Finetuning the pretrained model on instruction data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supervised finetuning stage involves another round of next-token prediction. However, unlike the preceding pretraining stage, we now work with instruction-output pairs, as depicted in the figure above. In this context, the instruction is the input given to the model (it is sometimes accompanied by an optional input text, depending on the task). The output represents a desired response similar to what we expect the model to produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide a concrete example, let's consider the following instruction-output pair:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Instruction: \"Write a limerick about a pelican.\"\n",
      "- Output: \"There once was a pelican so fine...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The model takes the instruction text (\"Write a limerick about a pelican\") as input and carries out next-token prediction for the output text (\"There once was a pelican so fine...\").\n",
      "\n",
      "While both employ a similar next-token training objective, supervised finetuning typically uses much smaller datasets than pretraining. This is because it requires instruction-output pairs rather than just raw text. To compile such a dataset, a human (or another high-quality LLM) must write the desired output given a specific instruction — creating such a dataset is a lot of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following this supervised finetuning stage, there's another finetuning phase commonly regarded as the \"alignment\" step, as its primary objective is to align the LLM with human preferences. This is where RLHF comes into play.\n",
      "\n",

However, for those curious about how it compares to the pretrained base model and the model from supervised finetuning in step 2, I included a chart (above) from the InstructGPT paper, which is the paper that popularized this procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chart above compares a 175B GPT-3 model after supervised finetuning (faint dotted line) with the other method. We can see the base GPT-3 model at the bottom of this chart. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we consider a prompting approach where we query it multiple times and select the best response each time (\"GPT-3 + prompting\"), we can see a somewhat improved performance over the base model (\"GPT-3\"), which is to be expected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adding supervised finetuning to the GPT-3 base model makes the performance (\"GPT-3 + supervised finetuning\") even better than \"GPT-3 + prompting\". \n",
      "\n",

This is because ranking responses is likely simpler than writing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon compiling a dataset with these rankings, we can design a reward model that outputs a reward score for the optimization subsequent stage in RLHF Step 3. This reward model generally originates from the LLM created in the prior supervised finetuning step. Let's refer to te reward model as RM and the LLM from the supervised finetuning step as SFT. To turn the model from RLHF Step 1 into a reward model, its output layer (the next-token classification layer) is substituted with a regression layer, which features a single output node.\n",

      "In summary, Llama-2-chat follows the same supervised finetuning step on instruction data as InstructGPT in *RLHF Step 1*. Yet, during *RLHF Step 2*, two reward models are created instead of just one. Furthermore, the Llama-2-chat model evolves through multiple stages, with reward models being updated based on the emerging errors from the Llama-2-chat model. There's also an added rejection sampling step.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Margin Loss**\n",
      "\n",
      "Another distinction not depicted in the above-mentioned annotated figure relates to how model responses are ranked to generate the reward model. In the standard InstructGPT approach for RLHF PPO discussed previously, the researchers collect responses that rank 4-9 outputs from which the researchers create “k choose 2” comparisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if a human labeler ranks four responses (A-D), such as A < C < D < B, this yields “4 choose 2” = 6 comparisons:\n",

      "5. C < B\n",
      "6. D < B\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, Llama 2’s dataset is based on binary comparisons of responses, like A < B. However, it appears that each human labeler was only presented 2 responses (as opposed to 4-9 responses) per labeling round.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, what’s new is that alongside each binary rank, a \"margin\" label (ranging from \"significantly better\" to \"negligibly better\") is gathered, which can optionally be used in the binary ranking loss via an additional margin parameter to calculate the gap between the two responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "While InstructGPT used the following cross entropy-based ranking loss to train the reward model:\n",

      "**Two reward models**\n",

In the sampling step, prompts and instructions are fed to the LLM to collect the responses. Based on an alignment score, the instruction is relabeled where appropriate in the training phase. Then, the relabeled instructions and the original prompts are used to finetune the LLM. Using this relabeling approach, the researchers effectively turn failure cases (cases where the LLM creates outputs that don't match the original instructions) into useful training data for supervised learning.\n",
